## What?

This is a pretty simple automated web scraper that I've written as a personal project.

Currently, it scans the sublease section of craigslist, and emails me sublease opportunities that fit my criteria.

Uses [postal](https://github.com/drewr/postal) for emailing and [jsoup](https://jsoup.org/) for html retrieval and parsing.
